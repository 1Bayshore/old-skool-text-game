Owen Text Game - bug list

x 	1. print exits when entering room
x 	2. Typing "look" starts with "You see" but long description doesn't match. Suggest drop "You see"
x 	3. don't print this player (e.g. "joe test") when looking in a room
	4. Add support for default commands:
		4a. exit verbs, e.g. "north" -> "go north"; "n" -> "go north", etc. Standard defaults are n, s, e, w, ne, nw, se, sw, u, d (up and down)
		4b. "l" for "look"
		4c. "look at" or "examine" -> print long description
		4d. Add alias system? So player can type e.g. "alias n north" and then just typing "n" is the same as typing "north". Then many default commands can just be implemented as built-in aliases
x 	5. get rid of debug output on parser, or make a command ("verbose") to toggle debug output on and off
	6. ignore prepositions and articles
	7. objects have a list of names and list of adjectives, parser checks these to find a match, if more than one match parser asks "did you mean" and lists short descriptions of both
	8. When describing a room (as opposed to other containers) don't print "it is empty" if nothing is there (because might contradict long description which may refer to "scenery" objects)
	9. adjectives and adverbs
x	10. implement "debug(x)" function that prints x if verbose is set, else passes
	11. add exits to kitchen
